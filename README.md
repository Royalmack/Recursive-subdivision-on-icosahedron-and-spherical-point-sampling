# Recursive subdivision of icosahedron and spherical point sampling

A program used to recursively subdivide an icosahedron into a sphere and place midpoints for each face.  Used to check if distribution around the sphere is even.

Point sampling works based on random point placement around a sphere and can be used with a predetermined amount of points ranging from 20-20480.
